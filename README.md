# TLScontact24 – Human-Like Visa Slot Monitor

**Status:** Internal project – source code is private.

## 📚 About

TLScontact24 is a bot that checks TLScontact visa portals every second,  
acts like a real person online, and alerts users the moment a free slot appears.

- **Human-like actions** – natural mouse moves, typing, scrolling.  
- **Captcha & anti-bot bypass** – slips past reCAPTCHA and other checks.  
- **Endless monitoring** – runs 24/7 without any human clicks.  
- **Instant alerts** – sends a “📅 Slot available!” message to Telegram.  

## 🎯 Who Needs This

- Travel agencies that book visa appointments.  
- Visa-service companies that do not want staff to press “Refresh” all day.  

## 💡 Key Results

- Staff save many hours each week.  
- Free slots are caught in under one second.
